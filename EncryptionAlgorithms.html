    Cryptography is broadly classified into two categories:
	<table style="width:50%">
  <tr>
    <th>Symmetric key Cryptography</th>
    <th>Asymmetric key Cryptography</th> 
  </tr>
</table>

<P>Now Symmetric key Cryptography is further categorized as Classical Cryptography and Modern Cryptography.</P>
 <P>Further drilling down, Classical Cryptography is divided into Transposition Cipher and Substitution Cipher. On the other hand, Modern Cryptography is divided into Stream Cipher and Block Cipher.</P>
