  <dd>- It is a service used to store information content from all people except those who have been authorized to view it.</dd>
  <dt>Integrity</dt>
  <dd>- It is a service used to keep information from being changed (deleted, added or modified) by people who are not authorized to do so.</dd>
  <dt>Authentication</dt>
  <dd>- It is a service that is used to verify the identity of the data owner (authorized).</dd>
  <dt> Non-repudiation</dt>
  <dd>- It is a service used to prevent a person from denying doing something.</dd>
