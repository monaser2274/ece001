    <h4>What Is Cryptography?</h4>
	<P>Cryptography is the practice and study of techniques for securing communication and data in the presence of adversaries.</p>

<p> Alright, now that you know ” what is cryptography ” let’s see how cryptography can help secure the connection between Andy and Sam.</p>
<p>So, to protect his message, Andy first convert his readable message to unreadable form. Here, he converts the message to some random numbers. After that, he uses a key to encrypt his message, in Cryptography, we call this ciphertext. </p>
<p>Andy sends this ciphertext or encrypted message over the communication channel, he won’t have to worry about somebody in the middle of discovering his private messages. Suppose, Eaves here discover the message and he somehow manages to alter it before it reaches Sam.</p>

<p>Now, Sam would need a key to decrypt the message to recover the original plaintext. In order to convert the ciphertext into plain text, Sam would need to use the decryption key. Using the key he would convert the ciphertext or the numerical value to the corresponding plain text.</p>
 <P>After using the key for decryption what will come out is the original plaintext message, is an error. Now, this error is very important. It is the way Sam knows that message sent by Andy is not the same as the message that he received. Thus, we can say that encryption is important to communicate or share information over the network.</p>
